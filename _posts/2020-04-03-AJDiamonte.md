title: AJ Diamonti, Empowering Caretakers 

---
>“basically Daisy and I said, “Look we are going to do it…” and the other family never paid taxes for her, and they said, “Well we’re not.” And that’s what happened going forward...we reported the income and we paid both sides of the social security the whole time through...because it felt like the right thing to do and we were swayed by the argument...that we had agreed on what she was going to be paid hourly and if she wasn’t anticipating having to pay social security and other taxes coming out if it, all of a sudden her income is significantly reduced in a way she’s not prepared for so. And it wasn’t a huge deal, again for us at the time to pay the social security, it wasn’t…I will say it wasn’t nothing and it would have been much less of a deal for the other family then for us but that is part of my continuing bitterness about that whole situation.”


**AJ Diamonti** shares his experience employing the domestic caretaker “Mina” through a nanny share group with another family. He reflects on the exploitation Mina experienced from the other employer and the importance of respect caretakers and their profession.

*“Housing costs are the largest expense for most domestic workers; 60 percent spend more than half of their income on rent or mortgage payments...And most strikingly, one in five workers report that in the past month there were times when there was no food to eat of any kind in their own home because they had no resources to obtain it.*
