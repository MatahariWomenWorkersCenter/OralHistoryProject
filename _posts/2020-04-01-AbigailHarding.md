title: Abigail Harding, "It is A Profession"
---

> I’m really grateful for [the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights], because it sets a standard to say that nannies are workers: we’re employed people. Some of us work independently, some of us for agencies, but we are employees, who are employed by people, so it is work. And we want the work to be… It is a profession - some people use it as their profession: they do this for life. And we want it to be respected in such a way that… It is something important, because we care for the kids, their families who have to go off to work, and that’s a big deal. Not everybody sees it like that, but if you really think about it: we care for their kids so they can go to their professions.

**Abigail Harding** was born in Barbados and grew up in Trinidad and Tobago. Harding moved to Boston in 2000 with her son, and started working as a nanny. At the time of the interview, Harding was working part time as a nanny while also in school at the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.

*The vast majority of domestic workers have no formal contract that establishes the basic parameters of their work; in fact, just 8 percent of workers have written contracts with their primary employer. It is far more common for employers to make some sort of verbal agreement with the domestic workers they hire. Two-thirds (67%) of workers indicate they had an informal conversation with their employer about job expectations, usually on their first working day. However, the verbal agreements, and even some of the written contracts that are in place, more often resemble a set of instructions to the worker than a contract in the legal sense, which binds both parties in their responsibilities to one another. Employers often regard contracts and agreements as nonbinding, and they rarely are revisited over the course of employment, leading to escalating expectations that workers must navigate.*
