title: Abigail Harding, "It is A Profession"
---

> I’m really grateful for [the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights], because it sets a standard to say that nannies are workers: we’re employed people. Some of us work independently, some of us for agencies, but we are employees, who are employed by people, so it is work. And we want the work to be… It is a profession - some people use it as their profession: they do this for life. And we want it to be respected in such a way that… It is something important, because we care for the kids, their families who have to go off to work, and that’s a big deal. Not everybody sees it like that, but if you really think about it: we care for their kids so they can go to their professions.
