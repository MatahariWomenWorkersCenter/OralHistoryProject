> AT: It’s not for for us… for Yadira… she… she, maybe if she were Irish or something and highly educated she would know her rights.  This is beyond rights.  This is like a family relationship. So, even if she knew about the law, which I doubt she…
Interviewer: Doubt she does.
AT: … it wouldn’t mean anything to her.  So, so..
Interviewer: And are there any things in the law, the kinds of things I just mentioned, that were sort of food for thought for you in terms of thinking about your relationship?
AT: I don’t think so.
RG: She would be afraid.
Interviewer: She’d be afraid of what?
RG: It would bother her. It would bother her to have a contract and have to sign something. Because their relationship is 24 years old.
Interviewer: And so personal?
RG: And so personal and so trusting.  So I think it would be all of a sudden, you know, maybe its like being married for a number of years and saying, “we need a prenup, you know, lets sign this.” That’s uncomfortable.
