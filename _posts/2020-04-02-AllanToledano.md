> AT: It’s not for for us… for Yadira… she… she, maybe if she were Irish or something and highly educated she would know her rights.  This is beyond rights.  This is like a family relationship. So, even if she knew about the law, which I doubt she…
Interviewer: Doubt she does.
AT: … it wouldn’t mean anything to her.  So, so..
Interviewer: And are there any things in the law, the kinds of things I just mentioned, that were sort of food for thought for you in terms of thinking about your relationship?
AT: I don’t think so.
RG: She would be afraid.
Interviewer: She’d be afraid of what?
RG: It would bother her. It would bother her to have a contract and have to sign something. Because their relationship is 24 years old.
Interviewer: And so personal?
RG: And so personal and so trusting.  So I think it would be all of a sudden, you know, maybe its like being married for a number of years and saying, “we need a prenup, you know, lets sign this.” That’s uncomfortable.

**Allan Toledano** was interviewed along with his wife Roz Graber to discuss his experience with his domestic employee, Yadira.  Through the course of his interview, Allan Toledano discussed his lifetime of experience having domestic workers in his life, How Yadira came to work for him and his opinion of what the challenges the domestic workers bill of rights have in his opinion.

* The vast majority of domestic workers have no formal contract that establishes the basic parameters of their work; in fact, just 8 percent of workers have written contracts with their primary employer. It is far more common for employers to make some sort of verbal agreement with the domestic workers they hire. Two-thirds (67%) of workers indicate they had an informal conversation with their employer about job expectations, usually on their first working day. However, the verbal agreements, and even some of the written contracts that are in place, more often resemble a set of instructions to the worker than a contract in the legal sense, which binds both parties in their responsibilities to one another*
