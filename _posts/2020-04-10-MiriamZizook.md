>“I think we would spend-like pay a lot of money for this care. (laughs) and that it would be the basic minimum income and also like I think there’s plenty of other mechanisms for compensating women for the work that they do unpaid. I think, I think paying for valuing and paying real money for like the unpaid work that women do is a really important ingredient in [caring for children with disabilities]. And like, I think that like the fact that this family is a one income family that with the as much as is on the plate of these two parents of like 2 disabled kids three kids that like, that’s a one income family and therefore they’re really resour-like, they’re really strapped all the time, is ridiculous because the cost of their kids is gonna fall somewhere. It’s sort of insane how little support there is. I mean, like even though they get, they get a lot of these hours like it just feels, just feels like its better for everybody to like, just actually compensate the work people are doing.
