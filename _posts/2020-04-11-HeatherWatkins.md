title: Heather Watkins, Sharing Life Experiences
---

>“...when [her caregiver comes] in again I go back to peace of mind where I can get all my needs met. So now I’m able to make my appointments, I’m able to be the advocate I want to be, so I can get there on time and give my life experience, but also when she’s talking to me about her experience as, you know, an immigrant, a mother, a grandmother, now I’m getting wisdom from her life experience, from her you know--you know, from her worldview. From her uh all of these different um uh things that have happened to her in her life I get a greater understanding and awareness of what that means to be her from her end in her words… it’s sort of cathartic to her in a way. I notice that once we start on one topic it eventually leads to others and there’s this relaxing sort of peace of her mind on her end. Maybe this something, you know, different things she’s been carrying a while and vice versa I’m the same way. I get started on a subject by the time she leaves I’m saying “thank you very much goodbye,” so it’s this nice learning exchange that takes place.”

**Heather Watkins** speaks about the two-way relationship between someone receiving care and a caregiver. In her experience with her caregiver she reflects on how they are able to speak to each other about their lives and that sharing these experiences opens her eyes to new worldviews.

*The majority of domestic work, including live-in and live-out, are largely composed of immigrant women as well as women of color.*
