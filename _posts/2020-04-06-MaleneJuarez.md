title: Marlene Juarez, Knowledge is Power

---
> While she continued to work for the family for another year, she was able to advocate for herself and eventually walk away from an employer who was abusive and trying to manipulate her since based on her immigration status. When it comes to her personal involvement in the [Matahari] organization, she discusses her outreach to other nanny’s as an educational pipeline and that supports her assertion that knowledge is power.

**Marlene Juarez** talks about the impact of being involved with the Matahari Women’s Workers Collective after migrating to the U.S from Honduras and getting a job as a nanny in Boston, MA.
