title: Fran Putnoi, Fair Immigration Policies for Better Lives and Pay
---
> “I think that it’s fantastic that there’s such a bill [Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights]. But I don’t think that the bill is enough until we solve the immigration problem. Because I mean it’s a step, but it’s all about the root cause and the root cause is that we do not have a fair policy around immigration.” [17]

>“... we’ve got a whole city that keeps on exploding in terms of building. and I bet you that the un- mounts of the undocumented workers every one of the buildings that surround my building, be shocking. [17]

>“...nobody can write a social security check. My building is not paying social security on
these people that work here, and have worked here for the whole twenty years that I’ve been
here. It’s absurd, so how do you solve that?” [17]


**Fran Putnoi**, who lives in Cambridge Mass, grew up with many domestic workers in her childhood home, and has hired domestic workers for all of her adult life. Fran is a first generation Jewish American, her father having survived the holocost and her mother a Turkish Jew. Fran grew up in a family where her mother’s business and parenting success was predicated on the help of housekeepers, cooks, and nannies whom all gave Fran a warm sense of family, home and security. As an employer herself, Fran is a strong advocate for, and friend of the people whom she hires to help her and her husband. Fran is in full support of immigration reform that will allow many hardworking uncdomented workers full benefits, better pay, social security money, college degrees. She does organizing work with her local synagogue and other volunteer Jewish organizations. Fran believes that employers and others in positions of power should advocate for their fellow kin, and thinks the Domestic Bill of Rights will help bring dignity and power to domestic workers in Massachusetts.  

*Undocumented workers face even greater challenges as they have no standing to negotiate better wages or living conditions in fear of their status being exposed even though they are reported to have more problematic working conditions as well work assigned outside of their job description. Undocumented workers are also more likely to be required to do unpaid work outside of their original job description and parameters.*
