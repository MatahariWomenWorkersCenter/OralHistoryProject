That is there.  And it's something uhm...I like it.  And it's why I have it in my ipad.  When I don't understand something, I google.  For example. for the cancer.  I google alot!  But I wrote alot alot alot and more that.  It was so scared for me because I wrote more that I have. And I say I don't read more and I ...now for example, in that time.  I be part of...I am mentor for Cancer Society.  I am mentor for Companeras de Apoyo en Washington.  I mentor for NJer in Chicago.  Now I am mentor for some Nannies too.  It's it's something my personality I try to, educate myself more more more more.  What I do I try to do the best."
