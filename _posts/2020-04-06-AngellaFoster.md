> I grew up in Jamaica in the sixties with my grandmother. She was a domestic worker. She usually just did laundry for people by hand. She used to do laundry for a Chinese family. She loved that family. They loved her too. in fact, when she died, they brought stuff for her funeral – everything.  They just took care of her. They had a bakery… I remember that the bakery had crispy patties. My grandmother would go to their store to wash, and she would get a patty, which is a pastry with Jamaican meatloaf filling inside. She would get that for lunch, and she would eat half of it and bring the other half home for my cousin and I. And you could see her teeth marks in it. There was another place that she also would work. It was an ice cream factory where she would wash the men’s white clothes. She would bring ice cream home for my cousin and I, but it was a long walk and the ice cream would melt. We would drink it. Today, I’m fifty-one, and whenever I eat ice cream, I have to take it out of the refrigerator and let it melt. My cousin does the same thing. Because that’s how we used to get our ice cream from my grandmother.
