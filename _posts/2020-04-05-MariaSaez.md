title: Cristina Saez, What do I want? More Respect

---
> What do I want from the bill? More respect. And from the person to do that and from the people who receive the help service, more respect and more “Oh okay you are professional.” And for the person you give the service to be more respectful.

**Maria Cristina Saez** was born in Argentina, moved to the United States to be with her husband and now nannies in Boston. She is a cancer survivor, former social worker, and avid skier.
